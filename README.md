- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Robo-Wiz
- ðŸ¤– Iâ€™m interested in making cool bots that can move, sense, and interact
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, JavaScript, HTML and CSS
- ðŸ“² Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Microbit projects. It is small but powerful, and so much fun to build with
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can spend hours coding without even realizing it! When I'm not on the computer, I also love going outside, stargazing, or learning random space facts. ðŸš€
