- 👋 Hi, I’m @Robo-Wiz. I am 10 year old and love exploring coding and technology!
- 🤖 I’m interested in making cool bots that can move, sense, and interact
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python 🐍💻, JavaScript, HTML and CSS
- 📲 I’m looking to collaborate on Microbit projects. It is small but powerful, and so much fun to build with
- ⚡ Fun fact: I started learning Python when I was 8 🎉 I can spend hours ⏰ coding without even realizing it! When I'm not on the computer, I also love going outside, stargazing 🌠, or learning random space facts. 🌍🚀

Feel free to explore my repositories, follow along with my coding journey, and connect if you have any cool ideas or want to collaborate on a project!
